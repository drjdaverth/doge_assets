Very Design.  So Assets.  Much Creative.  Wow!
=====================================
***

Greetings all. You look nice today!

As a fairly recent convert, I found /u/ummjackson's list of [dogecoin resources](https://github.com/ummjackson/dogecoin-resources) to be immensely helpful to getting off the ground.

___But what about the artsy stuff?___  We have so many creative individuals here just itching to remix, paste, morph, splice and animate their way to your dogey hearts.  Where are they supposed to go for assets?  Google?  

Please.

Well, [The_pun_fart](http://www.reddit.com/user/The_pun_fart) has been taking a stab at putting together an archive of images for everyone to use.  I'm not sure it's getting the visibility it deserves where it is and (forgive me but) Reddit isn't the best place to crowdsource a repository like this. Sooo, github FTW!!

Introducing: Doge Assets!!
====================

I've launched [Doge Assets](https://github.com/jdaverth/doge_assets) as a github project and it is live for your collaboration / leeching pleasure!  So far we have a hefty collection of Coins, Icons, Items, Models, and Logos as well as a showcase folder for examples.  And this is just step one -- how about music? Poetry? Github even has support for STL files (cough, hint) so bring on the 3D Printer models!

**I want this to be the go-to repo for you creative types** so bring on the suggestions and pull requests!  Maybe you just have an idea for how we can better organize it?  Maybe I've missed something entirely?  Maybe you just want to show off your awesome sauce!  Whatever ... as Mr Gaye says, "let's get it on!"

Some notes on Git / Github for Noobs
=============================

* **Just browsing**: No problem, [head on over](https://github.com/jdaverth/doge_assets) and start clicking some links.  You can navigate just like any file manager.  Clicking on a folder will open that folder, clicking on an image will open that image, clicking on ... you know, I think you get the idea!
* **Download a single file**: Go to the file, right-click and choose 'Save-as' or whatever your browser does for such things.  There's probably a more git-hubby way to do this.  I dunno ...
* **Download the entire repository**: A couple of options, but the easiest is probably to look on the right side of the screen for the button that says 'Download ZIP"  This will download the entire archive to your computer and you can use an unzip utility (buiilt-in to most OSs or you can download a free one like [PeaZip](http://peazip.sourceforge.net/) (Windows / Linux) or [The Unarchiver](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html) (OSX).  Or if you're one of the cool kids, just clone the repo (and make it better!)
* **Did you say clone?**: If you're new to git, 'clone' means downloading an entire copy of the repo to your desktop.  This includes not only the current version, but the entire history of changes, all active branches, etc.  If you want to contribute to the project, this is how you would begin.  You can clone using a GUI (e.g., click 'Clone in Desktop' button on the project page to get started) or from your terminal, simply use the clone url from the [project page](https://github.com/jdaverth/doge_assets).  

I'll try to respond quickly to any and all pull requests, so let's have 'em!  Or feel free to [message me directly](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=urthwalker) and I will provide whatever support I can.  Stackoverflow also has a decent [git for beginners](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide) guide.    

A Final Note On LICENSING
======================

Github doesn't allow for Creative Commons so I've gone with something called The Unlicense.

I have no idea what this is.

The short version is that this is a public repo, so let's all do our share to make sure we're adhering to copyrights.  **Please ensure that your contributions are either public domain, your own work, fair use, or otherwise not covered by somebody else's copyright**.  If you have any suggestions for a better licensing scheme for the project I welcome your expertise and will adjust accordingly.

Hey, you're awesome /u/urthwalker -- can I tip you?
=======================================

Sure!

Seriously though, I am doing this for the love of doge and nothing more.  That said, it is a fair amount of work, so if you feel the need then who am I to say no!  I'll make sure all proceeds go towards making the project better.
